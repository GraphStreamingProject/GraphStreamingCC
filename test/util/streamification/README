The command line arguments to the streamifiers are as follows:

(0) Input stream file name

(1) Parameter of geometric random variable describing the number of
reinsertions (or deletions) that an edge in the static graph gets. By
the end of the stream, exactly these edges will remain.  

(2) Maximum value for geometric random variable in (1) 

(3) Parameter of geometric random variable describing the number of
insert-delete pairs that any possible edge in the static graph gets. 
The number of such edges to consider is given in (5)

(4) Maximum value for geometric random variable in (3) 

(5) Number of edges not in the static graph to appear in the stream
(selected randomly)

(6) Output stream file name


The parameters that we have been using to generate graphs so far are:

(1) 0.99

(2) 10000

(3) 0.99

(4) 10000

(5) 1.01 times the number of edges in the static input graph
