# C++ Library for Solving the Connected Components Problem on a Graph Stream

## Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Create a `build` directory in the directory where you cloned this repository.
3. Initialize cmake by running `cmake ..` in the build dir.
4. Build the library and executables for testing by running `cmake --build .` in the build dir.

This library can easily be included with other cmake projects using FetchContent or ExternalProject.

## Debugging
You can enable build the symbol table for debugging with tools like `gdb` or `valgrind` by performing the following steps
1. Re-initialize cmake by running `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..` in the build directory
2. Re-build by running `cmake --build .` in the build dir.

To switch back to the optimized version of the code without the symbol table redo the two above steps except specify `Release` as the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.
Other build types are available as well, but these should be the only two you need.
